    "description": "This extension is used to crack pins on a beamed roblox account if you have this someone leaked it to you or you paid for it, is a process that takes around 30-45 minutes nothing will popup on ur screen but is gonna start guessing the pin first is going to try the pin by the birthday date set on the account or any other common pins if is none of them is going to start from 0001 - 9999 the best thing about this it bypasses the timeout from roblox and thats why it doesent need a whole day to crack the pin just click it and there will be a popup with the pin after the 30-45 minutes.

DISCLAIMER: dont be confused if nothing happens on ur screen just leave it running is cracking the pin in the background just leave the site open and dont touch nothing.",
